# Dice-Roll-Simulator
Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator project. The final version of the project features a dice at the center of the screen and a "Roll dice" button. The button triggers an animation and generates a random number, which is displayed in the center of the dice when clicked, t. Additionally, the number is added to a history list.
